            ASTHAMA
        </div>
       <div class="info">
            Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways,
            leading to symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing, and chest tightness.<br> While there is no
            known cure for asthma in conventional medicine, Ayurveda, a holistic system of medicine originating from
            India, offers approaches that aim to manage and alleviate asthma symptoms.
            Ayurveda offers holistic approaches to manage asthma symptoms:<br>

            Balancing Doshas: Ayurveda aims to restore dosha balance through personalized dietary and lifestyle changes.<br>

            Breathing Techniques: Pranayama exercises improve lung function and promote healthy breathing patterns.<br>

            Herbal Remedies: Ayurvedic herbs like turmeric and ginger have anti-inflammatory properties to ease airway
            inflammation.

            Dietary Guidance: Ayurveda recommends warm, easily digestible foods and avoids trigger foods.

            Stress Reduction: Stress-reduction techniques like meditation and yoga can help manage asthma triggers.

            Detoxification: Panchakarma detox therapies may remove toxins contributing to asthma.

            Ayurveda doesn't promise a cure but can complement conventional asthma management. Consult a healthcare
            professional before trying Ayurvedic treatments.
